## ✏️ How to Update Laptop Data

Updating the laptop list is super easy! All the data is located in the `laptopsData` array at the top of the `script.js` file. You can add, remove, or edit any laptop object in that array, and the website will automatically update when you reload the page.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

We have some exciting ideas for the future:

*   [ ] Add a dark mode toggle. 🌙
*   [ ] Implement sorting functionality for the tables (by price, brand, etc.).
*   [ ] Add a 'Compare' feature to see laptops side-by-side.
*   [ ] Integrate the 'Requirements Analysis' and 'Price Analysis' sections.
